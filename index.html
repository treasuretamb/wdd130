      Hello World! My name is Treasure and I currently reside in South Africa
      I fell in love with programming over ten years ago and I'm happy to 
      finally have the chance to learn how to code at an organised institution. 
      In my Spare time I like to watch series and movies, to read novels and articles, 
      to workout and exercise, to play sports, and to hang out with loved ones.
      I look forward to growing as a web developer and getting my degree.

      It is located right in the middle of the country meaning it is 
      bordered by all provinces. Gauteng is known for it's diversity and
